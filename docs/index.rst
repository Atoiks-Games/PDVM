PDVM
========================

The PDVM project began on August 8th 2018 with the goal of creating an imaginary architecture that features an extremely simple
instruction set while providing a multi-core environment. As stated on the project page, the name PDVM was not supposed to be a
meaningful acronym. Of course, you are free to make up your own, as long as it is not offensive.

The code for its reference implementation and debugging interface can be found `on GitHub`_.
